[["distributed-lag-models.html", "7 distributed lag models", " 7 distributed lag models Let y be a dependent variable and x an independent variable. The model \\[ y = \\alpha +\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\beta_kx_{t-k} +\\epsilon_t \\] is called a distributed lag model. The effect of the IV on the DV is distributed over a number of lags (e.g., y is sales and x is advertising). Weighted sum of the value of the X’s at time T and at previous times. Number of terms in the sum is infinite. Current and past advertising influences sales today. The x’s are being lagged. X_t - 1,2, etc. When k=0, then we have X_t. A special case (geometric decay) is given by \\[ \\beta_k = \\beta\\gamma^k \\] Some constnat Beta, and a gamma raised to the power k. If gamam is 1/2, then the weights are beta when k=0, then a half beta, quarter beta, 1/8 beta, etc. If the weights decrease in this geometric pattern, we call this geometric decay. For this case the model becomes \\[ y_t = \\alpha + \\beta(x_t + \\gamma*X_{t-1} \\] The backward shift operator B is defined by… \\[ \\] If you operate with B3, you shift backwards 3 times… Let’s substitue the backwards shift operator into the expression. Then, for geometric decay, the model is … \\[ y_t = \\alpha +\\beta(1+\\gamma\\beta + \\gamma^2\\beta^2+...) \\\\ =\\alpha+\\beta(1-\\gamma\\beta)^{-1}x_t + \\epsilon_t \\] by use of the geometric series summation. Now multiply on both sides by the oeprator 1-\\(\\gamma\\beta\\). This yields \\[ y_t = (1-\\gamma)\\alpha + \\gamma{y_{t-1}} + \\beta{x_t} + \\epsilon_t - \\gamma\\epsilon_{t-1} \\] or \\[ y_t = \\alpha&#39; + \\gamma{y_{t-1}} + \\beta{x_t} + \\epsilon&#39;_t \\] when geometric decay prevails to define the Beta_k’s. When the betas decrease in a geometric fashion, then you can re-write the model in this way. Second term is the auto-regressive term. Only have contemporaenous x. Also has an altered error structure. The original error structure is just epsilon_t. The lag one value of the DV appears on the right hand side as an explanatory variables, and the x variable appears only contemperaneously. The structure is first order auto-regressive structure. It is an arx model. Autoregressive becayse y is regressed back on itself, and the x denote the fact that there is an explanatory x variable. The epsilon is different from the original epsilon. When geometric decay prevails, there is this simpler way to write the model.
