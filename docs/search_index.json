[["spectral-density.html", "4 spectral density", " 4 spectral density Spectral density is a function that you can calculative, given the autocorrelations. Spectral Density is the transform of autocorrelation. This tells you that the information content of the autocorrelation and the spectral density are the same. Overall, they give same information about the time series. Two purposes of spectral density: plot the spectrum before you analyze the time series to see what kind of structure is there. In white noise, you see all the colors. In a plot of the visual spectrum, you see all the colors… not missing colors. If there was a band of colors that was missing, then the plot would drop down to 0 until it rises again to the relative height. White light contains all the colors of the visual spectrum. So when you have a time series that consist of uncorrelated, then you have a flat spectrum. When you calculate a spectram estimate in R, you have to specify a bandwidth for the estimate. Need to choose how many raw estiamtes. The periodogram. How many raw estatimes are averaged across the frequency. Common to choose the span to be a fraction of the sqrt(length of time series). So if length of TS is 360, sqrt = 19, half of that is 9, so span ~ 9. Here, don’t see a flat spectral density. Peak at the low frequencies (left end), meaning that there is remaining trend structure that the model does not capture. Also some spectral activity around frequencies around 432. Peaks are important, not the valleys. Peaks measure spectral power and the contribution to the variance. Half of the variance is equal to the area under the spectral curve. Still some variance attributable to trend because of peak at the low end. Is there any seasonal structure? at 1/12? Not a peak but some height. Take the length of the blue line segment, above the knot, and find if the length of that line segment is greater than the distance from the highest to lowest point. Looks like no, in this case, highest to lowest point exceeds twice that line segment length, so this does not invole reduction to white noise. Fluctuations like this show us that we haven’t reduced to white noise. The distances are small enough. spectrum(resid(model5), span = 8) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
